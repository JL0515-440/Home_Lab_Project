# Home Lab Project
This Repository is being made by me (MTHD), because I wanted to do research regarding on how some Cybersecurity "Penetration testing" Tools work. By doing this I'm creating a personal network so that way I do not affect my own machine, and any other external device.

I took inspiration from a lot of videos to do this project, as well as, some AI (ChatGPT and Gemini) bots to research ideas, but the one that encouraged me to do this project was this one in Youtube:

# Different Operating Systems and Virtual Machines
In this project I was using Virtual Box which is one of the most used VMs besides VMware.
