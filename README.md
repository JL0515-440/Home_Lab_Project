# Home Lab Project
This Repository is being made by me (JL0515-440), because I wanted to do research regarding on how some Cybersecurity "Penetration testing" Tools work. By doing this I'm creating a personal network so that way I do not affect my own machine, and any other external device.

I took inspiration from a lot of videos to do this project, as well as, some AI (ChatGPT and Gemini) bots to research ideas, but the one that encouraged me to do this project was this one in Youtube: 

**CyberDojo**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpFticDPEkw&list=PLtW3uHVuf_vgwHht2JTm_UUklczqz_PX7&index=76&t=523s

(Original Creator of the video I took inspiration from and many of the steps I have done in the project)

# Different Operating Systems and Virtual Machines
In this project I was using **Virtual Box** which is one of the most used VMs besides VMware. Here is the link of the website https://www.virtualbox.org/ I liked this VM because is free and it's easy to use if you don't know too much about Virtualization.

## Linux Operating Systems

In the Home Lab you can use whichever Operating System (OS) you prefer. In this Home Lab we are using **Ubuntu** and **Parrot OS (in this case the security version)**. Both are Linux Operating Systems which are used for different purposes. Ubuntu being as a one of the best options for general uses that an OS could have, as well as, being extremely light-weight, and Parrot OS - Security Version is an Operating System that has multiple tools from all the fields such as: Programming, Data Analysis, and Cybersecurity.

 These are the links for the Operating Systems that I'm using:

Ubuntu: https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop<br/>
Parrot OS: https://parrotsec.org/<br/>

Kali Linux (Although I didn't use it, in **CyberDojo**'s video he uses it to penetrate into Ubuntu's IP Address): https://www.kali.org/

# Setting Up the VMs

## Installing the OS in their respective VMs

Once we finished downloading everything we need to set up our OSs in their respective VMs.
